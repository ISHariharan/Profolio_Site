# Who Am I

As a versatile and dedicated professional, I bring a unique blend of skills in full stack development, UI/UX development, and graphic designing, coupled with a deep passion for handball. My experience spans developing comprehensive web solutions, designing intuitive user interfaces, and crafting visually compelling graphics, all while excelling as a committed handball player. Whether it's coding dynamic applications, creating engaging graphics, designing user-friendly interfaces, or leading my team on the handball court, I thrive on challenges and am driven by a desire to innovate and excel in every endeavor.

I am currently a final year B.Tech IT student at College Of Engineering Guindy (Anna University), where I continue to deepen my technical expertise and pursue my passion for technology.
